# Original README
> Blender RIP Add-On
> Version 0.1
> September 30th 2016
>
> Ported by Dummiesman from the vanilla NinjaRipper MaxScript
>
> 1.Requirements
>  The addon was created in Blender 2.77. If you have any issues with the addon in a previous Blender version, I will NOT provide support!!
>
> 2.Installation
>  Blender 32 Bit:
>    On 32 bit Blender installations, extract the downloaded ZIP file to
>    C:\Program Files (x86)\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.77\scripts\addon
>
>  Blender 64 Bit:
>    On 64 bit Blender installations, extract the downloaded ZIP file to
>    C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.77\scripts\addons
>
>  After you extract the Add-on, it will NOT show up in your import/export list by default!
>
>  After extracting the Add-on, start Blender. Once Blender is started, open up File->User Preferences, and navigate over to the Add-ons tab. Find the add-on or search "NinjaRipper", and enable it. Click "Save User Preferences" on the bottom of the dialog, and close the dialog.
>
>  Now you will be able to use the Add-on.
>
> 3.Importing
>  Textures
>    Based on the logic in the vanilla 3dsmax script, this add-on will attempt to import textures
